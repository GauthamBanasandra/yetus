<p>This change moves the default Apache Yetus docker image to a new version of Ubuntu as well as upgrades many, many bundled components to new releases.  Users utilizing the docker image should upgrade carefully!</p>

<p>Users:</p>

<p>The default branch setting for patch testing is now 'main'. Docker images based  upon Apache Yetus' top of tree are now tagged with 'main'.</p>

<p>Developers:</p>

<p>All references have been switched to 'main'.</p>

<!-- markdown -->
<p>If <code>--mvn-only-changed-tests=true</code> is added to the command line and a patch has only unit test modifications, test-patch will limit unit testing to just those tests.</p>

<p>This feature should be considered experimental at this time.</p>

<p>Developers:</p>

<p>This is a breaking change.  It reworks how tests should be registering the logfiles that they present to users and how bugsystem reporting engines should retrieve the filenames for those logfiles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add_vote_table() has been deprecated and replaced with add_vote_table_v2() that now takes an additional parameter.  Code that uses add_vote_table()/add_footer_table() combo will NOT have their log file entries reported with some bugsystem reporting engines.</li>
  <li>The TP_VOTE_TABLE has been re-arranged a bit to add in the log filename. Custom reporting engines will need to modified.</li>
</ul>

          <td><strong>Add GitHub Status as a report type</strong></td>

  </li>
</ul>

<!-- markdown -->
<p>This change replaces the Apache Yetus comment with (GitHub Status)[https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#statuses] notifications.  Note that your GitHub Token requires repo:status write or better privileges.</p>

<!-- markdown -->
<p>Prior to this change, using <code>qbt</code> or running <code>test-patch</code> on the tag of a repository under certain situations may have resulted in the tests being executed on a different commit.  After this change, the local repository's tags are forcibly updated from the remote repository's references when <code>--resetrepo</code> is passed as an argument.</p>

          <td><strong>GitHub Actions: use GitHub Checks for line comments support</strong></td>

<!-- markdown -->
<p>Users:<br />
Comments added on a per line basis were only ever shipped with support on GitHub, only on PRs, and was rarely used due to being very noisy.  That functionality has been removed and replaced with GitHub Checks Annotations when run under GitHub Actions with support for both branches and PRs.  Future/other changes may re-introduce support for non-GitHub Actions. Any 3rd party plug-ins that support line-level comments will need to be updated to support the new API.</p>

<p>Developers:<br />
With GitHub Checks Annotations being the preferred way on GitHub for CI systems to make individual notes, the API requirements and surrounding support structure for line comments have also changed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The unidiff line calculations (compute_unidiff)  has been removed.  This should greatly increase performance for large patches.</li>
  <li>Relatedly, GITUNIDIFFLINES has been removed from the global variables.</li>
  <li>(bugsystem)_linecoments and related functions should now expect and pass a column parameter. Log files should be in typical file:line[:column]:text format, where the missing column or 0 or "" will be used for no column/whole file.</li>
  <li>BUGLINECOMMENTS is no longer wiped when doing a diff vs. patch.</li>
  <li>(bugsystem)_linecomments will no longer receive comments grouped by file names.  Implementers will need to do their own grouping, if required.</li>
  <li>A new (bugsystem)_linecomments_end will be called when all line comments have been processed if there is any final work that needs to be done.</li>
</ul>
